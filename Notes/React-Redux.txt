Global State Management using Redux
-----------------------------------------------------

Create a Store : 
Which includes all states 
this store I will provide as provider to my app.js

Action:
which is act by users 

Reducers:
Its function which is triggered when the action is triggered to update the state.

Component:
You can see the state and also you can trigger the action.

useSelector Hook:
To read the state.

useDispatch Hook:
To action trigger.


If there is too many reducers.

So, We can combine them into a Root Reducer.
