How to create React application?

Old way:
-- first install react: npm i create-react-app -g (install this package globally)
-- now after installation use it for creating application
       create-react-app appname(you can give any name to your application)

   Make sure not ot give any space, special symbol and capital letters.


New way
-------------------
use npx command: npm execute means it will execute a particular command in the background rather than installing that library you can still
create React application.
